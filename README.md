# HR-Attrition-Dashboard
I have visualized the HR Attrition data using Power BI.

The conclusion from the HR analytics report on employee attrition includes several critical observations and insights. Here’s a summary:

1) Education Field: The highest attrition rates are seen in the Life Sciences and Medical fields, while Human Resources has the lowest attrition.

2) Work-Life Balance: Employees with a 'Good' work-life balance have the highest attrition rate, suggesting that even those with decent work-life conditions may still leave.

3) Distance from Home: Those living 'Nearby' have the highest attrition, which could indicate other motivating factors for leaving beyond commuting distance.

4) Age: The attrition is fairly evenly spread across the 18-30 and 31-45 age groups, with a notable drop in the 46-60 age group.

5) Marital Status: Single employees have the highest attrition, followed by married, and then divorced employees.

6) Gender: Female employees have a significantly higher attrition rate compared to male employees.

7) Job Role: Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives exhibit the highest attrition, while roles like Managers and Research Directors have much lower attrition rates.

8) Business Travel: Employees who travel rarely have higher attrition rates compared to those who travel frequently or do not travel at all.

9) Department: The Research & Development department sees the highest attrition, followed by Sales, with Human Resources having the lowest.

10) Years in Current Role: Attrition is highest in the early years of an employee's role, decreasing as they spend more years in the same position.

11) Job Level: Entry-level positions see the highest attrition, while executive and senior levels see the lowest.

12) Monthly Income: There’s a varied relationship between monthly income and attrition across different job roles, with some higher-income roles like Managers still seeing high attrition.

13) Over Time: Employees working overtime have slightly higher attrition rates compared to those who do not.

Final Conclusion
The report suggests that employee attrition is influenced by a combination of factors including educational background, work-life balance, commuting distance, age, marital status, gender, job role, business travel, department, tenure in current role, job level, and overtime work. To address high attrition rates, especially in critical areas like Life Sciences, Medical, and entry-level positions, organizations need to develop targeted retention strategies.
